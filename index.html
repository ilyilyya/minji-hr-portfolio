        <h2>Growth Process</h2>
        <blockquote>"If you know how to love yourself, then love and care for others."</blockquote>
        <p>
            This has been the guiding value in my life. I believe that one’s attitude is the mirror of the heart and reflects one’s thoughts. Moreover, I believe that such an attitude is shaped through everyday actions. When you are honest with yourself and compassionate towards others, accepting them for who they are, you often find that people naturally develop a positive impression of you—even love you. I experienced this firsthand during my school years, realizing that a single kind word could dramatically affect someone’s day.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the past, I was highly critical of myself. Constantly feeling that I was academically behind or lacking compared to others, I fell into the habit of comparing myself to everyone, which led me to dwell in negative emotions such as sadness, self-pity, despair, and a sense of failure. This self-deprecating mindset adversely affected the way I interacted with others and strained my relationships. Eventually, I recognized that if I viewed myself negatively, I would end up viewing others through a similarly distorted lens. I came to understand that respecting and loving oneself is the foundation for respecting others. After learning to love myself and change my attitude, I noticed that those around me began to see me in a better light. This change in perspective ultimately transformed my life.

        <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
        <p>
            I have always been someone who does not fear new challenges but rather enjoys them, investing immense energy into trying new things. One of the most transformative experiences in my life was studying abroad. Feeling stifled by the rigid, grade-focused environment of high school in Korea, I chose to pursue an international education when I felt that my abilities and talents were unfairly confined. While attending a two-year college, I simultaneously completed my high school education. A decision born out of the unbridled confidence of my younger self. This experience reaffirmed my strong belief in myself, even though it came with significant responsibility and pressure. I learned that self-confidence can generate tremendous synergy in achieving goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I played a supportive role at the International Office by helping students who struggled with English. I was actively involved in planning orientation events for new students every semester and organizing various school events, which encouraged and motivated the students. Through these activities, I learned that effective communication isn’t merely about listening; it involves understanding the underlying motives and emotions behind what someone is saying, as well as providing thoughtful feedback. These experiences taught me that people feel comforted and trusted when they have someone who truly listens to their stories. Every conversation I had reinforced the importance of attentive listening, ultimately reshaping my communication style and approach to dialogue. These experiences also helped me grow personally, as I was able to improve upon my shortcomings through interactions with a diverse group of students.

        <h2>Strengths & Weaknesses in Work Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            One of my greatest strengths is my adaptability. Like a chameleon, I embrace change without fear, adjusting quickly to new environments. This ability has been particularly valuable during my five years of studying in the United States. When faced with language barriers, I remained determined to improve, actively engaging in conversations with people from diverse backgrounds. Through these interactions, I developed strong communication skills that transcend language differences. By working on team projects, assisting Korean students in overcoming language challenges, and helping international students integrate into school life, I honed my ability to connect with others through verbal and non-verbal communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            I take pride in my ability to facilitate understanding among people from different cultures, whether through language, gestures, or shared experiences. This open-minded approach has strengthened my interpersonal skills, making me an effective communicator with both competence and empathy.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, one of my weaknesses is my strong desire for achievement. While ambition drives me to excel, it sometimes leads me to set high expectations for myself. I am continuously working on finding a balance between striving for excellence and maintaining a healthy perspective on success.
