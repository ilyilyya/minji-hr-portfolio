        <h2>Growth Process</h2>
        <blockquote>"If you know how to love yourself, then love and care for others."</blockquote>
        <p>
            This has been the guiding value in my life. I believe that one’s attitude is the mirror of the heart and reflects one’s thoughts. Moreover, I believe that such an attitude is shaped through everyday actions. When you are honest with yourself and compassionate towards others, accepting them for who they are, you often find that people naturally develop a positive impression of you—even love you. I experienced this firsthand during my school years, realizing that a single kind word could dramatically affect someone’s day.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the past, I was highly critical of myself. Constantly feeling that I was academically behind or lacking compared to others, I fell into the habit of comparing myself to everyone, which led me to dwell in negative emotions such as sadness, self-pity, despair, and a sense of failure. This self-deprecating mindset adversely affected the way I interacted with others and strained my relationships. Eventually, I recognized that if I viewed myself negatively, I would end up viewing others through a similarly distorted lens. I came to understand that respecting and loving oneself is the foundation for respecting others. After learning to love myself and change my attitude, I noticed that those around me began to see me in a better light. This change in perspective ultimately transformed my life.

        <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
        <p>
            I have always been someone who does not fear new challenges but rather enjoys them, investing immense energy into trying new things. One of the most transformative experiences in my life was studying abroad. Feeling stifled by the rigid, grade-focused environment of high school in Korea, I chose to pursue an international education when I felt that my abilities and talents were unfairly confined.

            Additionally, I played a supportive role at the International Office by helping students who struggled with English. I was actively involved in planning orientation events for new students every semester and organizing various school events, which encouraged and motivated the students. Through these activities, I learned that effective communication isn’t merely about listening; it involves understanding the underlying motives and emotions behind what someone is saying, as well as providing thoughtful feedback.

        <h2>Strength & Weakness</h2>
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <p>
            I consider my adaptability to adjust quickly to changing environments to be one of my greatest strengths. During the five years I studied in the United States, whenever I encountered communication challenges or felt my own limitations, I refused to give up and instead committed to learning and improving through constant effort and interaction with many people.
        </p>

        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
            My eagerness to achieve results has sometimes been a double-edged sword. During my college years, I balanced part-time jobs, club activities, and collaborative projects simultaneously. In my attempt to juggle everything, I once nearly missed a project deadline, which could have adversely affected my teammates.
