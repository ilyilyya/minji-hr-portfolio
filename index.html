    <section id="about" class="container">
        <p>Welcome to my HR portfolio! I am an aspiring HR professional with a background in administrative support, event coordination, and research.
            My expertise lies in workplace diversity, employee engagement, and organizational development.</p>

        <h2>Self-Introduction Statement</h2>
        <p>My name is Minji Choi, and I am passionate about Human Resources and Marketing, with a strong background in administration, communication, and strategic planning. Currently, I am completing my final quarter at the University of Washington, majoring in Business Economics(BA) & Cultural Literature and Art with a minor in Visual Media Art. My academic journey has shaped my ability to analyze human interactions, cultural dynamics, and organizational structures—skills that are essential in HR and marketing fields.</p>
        <p>Throughout my career, I have gained hands-on experience in administrative support, event coordination, and research. At Rinsam Academy, I worked as an Administrative Assistant, where I streamlined operational processes and improved student support systems. Additionally, as a Marketing & Event Coordinator at Cascadia College, I successfully organized promotional events and engaged diverse audiences through social media campaigns. My recent research on employee engagement, diversity in the workplace, and the role of MBTI in HR reflects my deep interest in optimizing workplace culture and enhancing organizational effectiveness.</p>
        <p>As a bilingual professional fluent in Korean and English, I bring a global perspective and strong interpersonal skills to any team. My adaptability, problem-solving abilities, and data-driven approach allow me to contribute effectively to HR and marketing initiatives. I am eager to apply my knowledge and experience to create inclusive, engaging work environments that drive employee satisfaction and business success.</p>
        <p>I look forward to new opportunities where I can combine my analytical skills and creativity to make a meaningful impact in HR and marketing.</p>
