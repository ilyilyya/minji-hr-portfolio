    <section id="about" class="container">
        <p>Welcome to my HR portfolio! I am an aspiring HR professional with a background in administrative support, event coordination, and research.
            My expertise lies in workplace diversity, employee engagement, and organizational development.</p>

        <h2>Growth Process & Professional Development for HR</h2>
        <p>‚ÄúIf you know how to love yourself, then you can love and care for others.‚Äù This belief has shaped my personal and professional journey, emphasizing the importance of self-awareness and emotional intelligence in fostering strong relationships. I have always viewed an individual‚Äôs attitude as a reflection of their inner thoughts and values, shaped through daily actions. Early on, I realized that when you practice honesty with yourself and show compassion toward others, meaningful and positive connections naturally develop.</p>
        <p>However, I did not always have this mindset. In the past, I was highly critical of myself, constantly comparing my academic progress and achievements to those of others. This habit led to self-doubt, discouragement, and strained relationships. Over time, I learned that how I perceive myself directly impacts my ability to understand and connect with others. This realization became a turning point, leading me to embrace self-acceptance, which, in turn, allowed me to foster deeper, more positive interactions with those around me. This experience significantly shaped my approach to Human Resources, reinforcing the importance of employee well-being, workplace culture, and emotional intelligence in professional settings.</p>

        <h2>Self-Introduction Statement</h2>
        <p>My name is Minji Choi, and I am passionate about Human Resources and Marketing, with a strong background in administration, communication, and strategic planning. Currently, I am completing my final quarter at the University of Washington, majoring in Business Economics(BA) & Cultural Literature and Art with a minor in Visual Media Art. My academic journey has shaped my ability to analyze human interactions, cultural dynamics, and organizational structures‚Äîskills that are essential in HR and marketing fields.</p>
        <p>Throughout my career, I have gained hands-on experience in administrative support, event coordination, and research. At Rinsam Academy, I worked as an Administrative Assistant, where I streamlined operational processes and improved student support systems. Additionally, as a Marketing & Event Coordinator at Cascadia College, I successfully organized promotional events and engaged diverse audiences through social media campaigns. My recent research on employee engagement, diversity in the workplace, and the role of MBTI in HR reflects my deep interest in optimizing workplace culture and enhancing organizational effectiveness.</p>
        <p>As a bilingual professional fluent in Korean and English, I bring a global perspective and strong interpersonal skills to any team. My adaptability, problem-solving abilities, and data-driven approach allow me to contribute effectively to HR and marketing initiatives. I am eager to apply my knowledge and experience to create inclusive, engaging work environments that drive employee satisfaction and business success.</p>
        <p>I look forward to new opportunities where I can combine my analytical skills and creativity to make a meaningful impact in HR and marketing.</p>

        <h2>Academic & Professional Journey in HR</h2>
        <p>I have always welcomed challenges, believing that each one is an opportunity for personal and professional growth. My decision to study abroad was one such challenge that significantly shaped my perspective. Coming from a highly competitive and rigid academic environment in Korea, I sought an educational system that valued holistic growth. This led me to enroll in a dual-enrollment program, completing both high school and college coursework simultaneously. This experience not only tested my resilience but also strengthened my time management, adaptability, and problem-solving skills‚Äîessential qualities for any HR professional.</p>
        <p>During my studies, I took on a supportive role at the International Office, assisting students who faced language barriers and cultural
adjustments. Organizing orientation events and school programs allowed me to engage with students from diverse backgrounds, helping them navigate new environments. These experiences deepened my understanding of effective communication, which extends beyond words to include active listening, empathy, and cultural sensitivity‚Äîkey skills in talent management and employee engagement.</p>
        <p>Additionally, my research on the role of MBTI in HR and the impact of diversity and inclusion in the workplace reflects my interest in understanding how different personality types and cultural backgrounds influence teamwork, leadership, and overall job satisfaction. My academic journey has reinforced my passion for creating inclusive and supportive work environments where employees feel valued and understood.</p>
